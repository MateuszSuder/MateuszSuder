### Welcome!
My name is Mateusz Suder and I'm on my way to become Frontend Developer!

Frontend is my passion since 5 years now, I've learned a lot since then and I think now is the time for my dream to come true and be included in some bigger projects that I would loved to be part of!

## Some more about me
I'm IT Student, computer geek that love new technologies, I'm always trying to learn something new from them. I always loved this original games like minesweeper or tetris and now I'm really into Online Casinos, mostly Slot machines, but I think of them more like art or just pure fun than gambling.

Beacuse of things I like I always tried to keep them together, that's why you can find Minesweeper in JS or games in PixiJS on in my repositories! I'm really happy I can keep my passion to Frontend and those games together and I would love to be part of bigger projects using this technologies.
